Although every medieval manuscript was presumably made to be used,
some were particularly “utilitarian” in that they presented pragmatic
knowledge that was useful for readers with a certain professional occupation,
such as merchants, notaries, and physicians.
The texts in these manuscripts are sometimes referred to as “Fachliteratur,”
or “professional” literature.
Consulting a manuscript for a professional task often demanded specific design
features, which impacted the way that scribes organized the information
contained in the manuscript.
The scientific and medical manuscripts in this section, for example, look very
different from manuscripts used for religious purposes.
Many have a more plain or even “scruffy” appearance, which is probably because
they were made for personal use by the professionals themselves.
The manuscript in the section also frequently present tables and schemes, or
other tools to support the professional reader in his or her occupation.
Like manuscripts made for education, books for professional use tended to be
annotated more frequently.
In general, the pragmatic objects available here often present an interesting
puzzle: many of their pages contain subtle clues as to how they were handled
by their original owners.
