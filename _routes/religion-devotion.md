Arguably the majority of manuscripts made in the Middle Ages served a
religious or devotional function.
It is telling that the top three of popular reads in the later medieval
period were the Bible, Book of Hours, and Psalms.
These were do-it-yourself manuals, in a sense, given that they showed how
to live a good Christian life.
Religious and devotional manuscripts survive in very large numbers from
medieval monasteries, where they served a variety of purposes, from majestic
manuscripts made for consultation in the library (sermons and glossed bibles,
for example), to heavily-used copies available for general use in church and
refectory.
In the 14th and 15th centuries, religious and devotional manuscripts also
became popular with private owners, many of whom lived in the cities.
The Book of Hours, for example, provided private readers with an opportunity
to regulate their devotional lives in the manner of monks and nuns: the books
facilitated reading specific texts at specific hours of the day.
The kind of books seen in this section often presents a somewhat predictable
material design, in large part because the objects are affiliated to specific
religious rituals, such as reading or singing out loud during the Mass.
From the 13th century onwards, religious and devotional manuscripts also became
available in the vernacular, for example in Middle Dutch.
While these manuscripts were not used in the same settings as their Latin
counterparts, they served the same purpose: to support devotional readers in
their daily religious experience and help secure a heavenly afterlife.
