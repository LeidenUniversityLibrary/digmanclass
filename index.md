Welcome to Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom!
This educational resource is a collection of selected digitised manuscripts
from [Leiden University Libraries][ubl], organised in thematic routes.
You are welcome to use (parts of) this collection in your classes. Please see
the [colophon](colophon/) for details on how to use and improve these
materials.
*Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom is currently released in beta.*

Each manuscript can be viewed in high resolution and read in the browser.
Summaries with links to the included [glossary][g] and to Wikipedia, as well as
links to specific parts of the manuscript, help students understand all
aspects of the production and use of manuscripts.
The study of these manuscripts is guided by a set of questions that can
be answered by looking at the digitised objects.
