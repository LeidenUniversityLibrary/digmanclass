One of the most influential scholars who wrote about alchemy was [Roger
Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon), also known as "Doctor
Mirabilis" (the marvelous doctor). Bacon was an English philosopher and
a Franciscan friar. He was the first in Europe to record the formula for
gunpowder, and he is sometimes credited for finding the formula for the
[Philosopher's
Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone) (see also
VCF 6). This manuscript contains his text *De mirabili potestate artis
et naturae* (On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature). It is composed
as a letter to an unknown William of Paris and contains several
alchemical formulas.
One of the owners of this manuscript was [Petrus
Vok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Vok_of_Rosenberg), a Czech
nobleman of the [House of
Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenberg_family), a
significant Bohemian noble family. In 1609 he added an
*[ex-libris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookplate)* to the first
flyleaf of the manuscript to indicate his ownership. Other notable
owners of this manuscript were lay alchemist Lorentz Zatzer (whose
initials are slightly visible on the cover of the manuscript) and [Isaac
Vossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Vossius) (fol. 1r). There
is an additional name that was crossed out on fol. 195v. These owners --
and perhaps others -- added several notes in the margins. From fol. 131v
onwards you can see many maniculae[^1]; drawings of tiny hands used to
point to relevant passages in the text.
