This manuscript contains several treatises in Middle Dutch supposedly
written by [Isaac
Hollandus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Isaac_Hollandus),
considered to be one of the most influential authors of alchemical texts
from the sixteenth century. There is not much known about this author,
though there are several theories. One theory is that he was a Flemish
alchemist who worked together with his son, Johannes Isaac Hollandus.
Another theory is that Isaac and Johannes Isaac were brothers, while
still another says that the two names belonged to the same person. It's
also possible that "Isaac Hollandus" was a pseudonym used by another
alchemist. The first two treatises in the manuscript concern the
[Philosopher's
Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone) (see also
VCF 6). The third is about the properties of wine, which many believed
could be used for medicinal purposes, such as healing dementia or
sinusitis.

The top of each page of this manuscript contains running titles[^1] in red
ink, which made it much easier for the reader to see which treatise he
or she was reading. From fol. 22v onwards the manuscript contains
several drawings of various *laboratory glassware items*. There is an
empty space on fol. 68v, which was probably meant for a more elaborate
drawing that was never completed.
