This manuscript was in the possession of the Abbey of Arnstein in
Germany (see fol. <span data-fol="60v" class="fref">60v</span>), whose members belonged to the order of the
[Norbertines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premonstratensians). The
Norbertines adhered to the [Rule of St.
Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinians)
which, amongst other things, prescribes chastity, poverty and obedience.
Whenever a person entered the convent he or she vowed to follow these
rules. This manuscript contains the Rule of St. Augustine as well as
general rules concerning the admission of new members to the Order,
blessings for sacred garments, and a calendar.

The calendar in this manuscript contains tables to determine the dates
of Easter, which is celebrated on or after the first full moon following
the spring equinox. The scribe usually wrote down the year in which he
finished copying the manuscript in the
[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus) circle, helping
modern readers determine the date of production. The computus circle on
fol. <span data-fol="60v" class="fref">60v</span> in this manuscript reads "M.V. hundert und vii", which tells us
it was created in 1507. Even though the main texts in this manuscript
are written in Dutch, the rubrics are written in German. There are parts
of the text that were meant to be sung. These parts are written on
musical staff-lines.
