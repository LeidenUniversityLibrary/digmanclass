[Maximilian
I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)
(1459-1519), Holy Roman Emperor from 1508 until his death in 1519, was
an advocate for the development of arts and sciences. He was known to
surround himself with famous scholars. This manuscript contains two
treatises from a servant of a physician who worked at the court of
Maximilian (fol. 12v). It is possible that the emperor was composing his
own [pharmacopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacopoeia) - an
official guide for the use and identification of medicine (see also BPL
3284).

In addition to the two treatises, this manuscript also contains several
texts on alchemy. One alchemical recipe describes how to make oil from
cream of tartar. Another teaches the reader how to make noble metals.
This manuscript belonged to Wolfen Herrn zue Regendorff (see flyleaf at
the front), most likely a priest from Regendorf, Germany. Even though
the leaves provide plenty of space for commentary, the readers' notes[^1]
in this manuscript are minimal. Some of the pages are decorated with
drawings of small bottles and other laboratory glassware (see for
example fol. 9v).
