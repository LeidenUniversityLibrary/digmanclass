This [book of hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours) was
obtained by Marcus Jansen from Amersfoort (the Netherlands) in the
middle of the seventeenth century and later became the first manuscript
in the possession of the Convent of St. Agnes in Amersfoort. Marcus
personalized this manuscript by writing down his family history on the
flyleaves, including information about the death of his wife Annetjen
Willems in 1652 and about his marriage to his second wife, Elysabet
Syberts, in 1653. We know from an additional note written by the person
that obtained the book after Marcus' death that he died in 1670 and was
buried in the *Cattuijsers kerckhoeff*.

This manuscript contains several texts, which were all written by a
single scribe. It discusses the Last Supper, the Passion of Jesus, and
the Resurrection, and is based on the [Gospel
Harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_harmony) by Johannes
Scutken (*d.* 1423). Scutken, a student of Geert Grote, translated the
New Testament into Dutch. It is estimated that over one hundred and
fifty manuscripts containing his text have survived. The second text in
this manuscript is a Dutch translation of an excerpt from [Henricus
Suso's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Suso) *Horologium aeternae sapientiae* (The Clock of Wisdom).

This manuscript is beautifully decorated with pen-flourished initials.
Fols. 12v-13r show three
[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus) circles used to
determine the date of Easter. The text in the circle in fol. 12v asks
the reader to start looking for the Golden Number from "drientsestig"
(sixty-three), which tells us that the manuscript was written in 1463.
