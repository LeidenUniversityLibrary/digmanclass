The [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order) was
founded in the beginning of the thirteenth century by Dominic of
Caleruega (1170-1221). One of the most famous Dominicans, archbishop and
author [Jacobus de Voragine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_da_Varagine)
(*c*.1228-1298), published multiple volumes of collected
[sermons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon) (see also LTK 263 and
LTK 278). This manuscript contains his *Sermones de tempore et de sanctis* (Sermons for Feast Days and Saints' Days) which includes
sermons for Sundays, Lent, saints' days and other holy days. The
manuscript belonged to the Convent of the Virgin in Gaesdonk (the
Netherlands) (see also BPL 2231 and BPL 2483).

The sermons in this manuscript are all written in Latin, which tells us
that the sermons were created for the clergy and not lay people, who
generally could not understand Latin. Even though the manuscript was
probably used by the monks of the convent, there are few annotations and
traces of use in the margins. Perhaps the book was not used regularly
but mainly served as inspiration for other sermons.

The sermons in the manuscript are separated from each other by a blank
page. The flyleaf at the end of the book is a fragment of a calendar,
probably from the fourteenth century. The manuscript still has its
original binding.[^1]
