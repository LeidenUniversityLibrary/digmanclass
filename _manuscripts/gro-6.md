This manuscript belonged to professor of
[rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) Michael Junta de
Santa Croce of Florence. It is therefore no surprise that the five texts
included concern the subject of rhetoric. Parts three and four (fols. 56 - 115), written by Michael Junta himself, contain composed practical
exercises in Italian and a commentary on the [*Ad herennium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium) (here
wrongly attributed to [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero),
see also BPL 195). Junta probably used these exercises during his
lessons. The flyleaves at the front of the manuscript describe the
import duties of the city of Prato, near Florence.

The five parts of this manuscript differ strongly from each other in
lay-out and wear-and-tear, showing that they circulated individually
prior to being bound together. The first part, containing the *Ad herennium*, has, for example, many more reader-contributed annotations
than the other parts. Another sign is that the leaves of part three are
damaged by water or mold, but the other parts appear untouched by the
damage. Part one, two, three, and five still have empty spaces where an
illuminator was supposed to add pen-flourished initials.[^1]
