One of the most influential alchemical works of the Early Modern Period
is the *[Pretiosissimum donum Dei](http://www.alchemywebsite.com/donumdei.html)* (The Most Precious
Gift of God). The author of this book, probably Georgius Aurach de
Argentina, starts his text by thanking God for his inspiration. The
*donum Dei* was particularly famous for the series of twelve
illustrations that show the personifications of alchemical processes.
The scribe has copied the text of the *donum Dei* as well as the
illustrations in this manuscript. The illustrated scenes take place
inside glass bottles and frequently depict a king and a queen which, in
alchemical symbolism, often represent two opposite elements, just like
the sun and the moon (see also VCF 17). This manuscript also contains
five alchemical texts written by [Arnaldus de
Villanova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova) (c.
1240-1311). De Villanova was an alchemist, astrologer, and physician who
translated many Arabic medical texts into Latin.

From fol. <span data-fol="242r" class="fref">242r</span> onwards the scribe has added many drawings of the various
laboratory glassware items used in chemical experiments. There are also
drawings of complicated constructions that look like small buildings
(see fol. <span data-fol="253v" class="fref">253v</span>). This manuscript was copied by two scribes. The second
scribe (who copied fols. <span data-fol="139r" class="fref">139</span> - <span data-fol="345v" class="fref">345</span>) wrote down his initials on fol. <span data-fol="345v" class="fref">345v</span>:
SPD.
