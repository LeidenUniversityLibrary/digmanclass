Texts may lose their popularity overtime. This almost happened to
[Ovid's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid)
*[Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_(poem))* (The
Book of Days) - six books in which the origins of Roman customs and
their holidays are explained. For several centuries this text was used
by teachers to instruct students in Latin grammar and Roman cultural
practices and beliefs. In the twentieth century, however, scholars
criticized the *Fasti* for being full of errors and declared it an
unreliable source. The text regained its popularity during the 1980s,
and is now considered to be one of Ovid's major works.

This twelfth-century manuscript contains part of the *Fasti* (books 1,
2, and 3 are missing) in addition to fragments of the *[Ilias Latina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilias_Latina)* and
the *De quantitate vocabulorum*. The manuscript is a so-called "holster
book", due to its long, narrow format. In holster books, the page's
width equals sixty percent or less of its height. The unusual size was
convenient for teachers, as the books could easily be held in one hand
while he was walking through the classroom. Many manuscripts from the
eleventh and twelfth centuries are in holster format. The glosses[^1] in
the manuscript are from the thirteenth through the fifteenth centuries,
showing that the text was frequently studied over a long period of time.
