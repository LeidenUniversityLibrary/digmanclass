The original calf binding of this manuscript has suffered much wear and
tear throughout the last four centuries. Beneath the leather on the back
of the binding you can see that the wooden boards were covered with
paper fragments from a printed book, which tells us that both
manuscripts and printed books were victims of recycling during the early
days of the printing press. It also shows us that even at the end of the
sixteenth century some books were still copied by hand.

This manuscript contains several texts by [Arnaldus de
Villanova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldus_de_Villa_Nova),
[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), Rosinus and
Raymundus Lullus. [Lullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull)
(1232-1315) was a Spanish philosopher who wrote more than 250 texts on
various subjects. The scribe and first owner of this manuscript was
physician Lorentz Zatzer. Zatzer included two of his own recipes in the
manuscript. Whenever he finished copying a certain passage he wrote down
his name and the date (see for example fol. 110 *Finis Lor. Zatz., vollendet den 1 Apprili Anno 1574*). Other owners of this manuscript
were Hans Thyle (see binding *Han Thyle 160*), [Cardinal Franz
Dietrichstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Dietrichstein),
[Christina, Queen of
Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden), and
[Isaac Vossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Vossius) (see also
VCF 13).
