The author of one of the texts in this manuscript describes a recipe
while giving a warning to the reader not to reveal the contents of the
recipe to anyone who is not educated in philosophy. These kinds of
warnings were typical for
[alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy) treatises.
Alchemists believed that their knowledge of natural objects and their
properties could easily be misused by inexperienced people. That
alchemists were cautious with spreading their ideas is understandable,
since most alchemical treatises describe how base metals could be turned
into noble metals like silver and gold.

This manuscript contains a variety of treatises on alchemy, often
accompanied by practical recipes. Even though the treatises do not deal
with religious subjects directly, the reader is often encouraged to give
praise Jesus before he or she starts making a recipe. One of the owners
has added annotations in the margin in red ink. Important passages are
either pointed out with a manicula\* or by writing "nota" (note this!)
in the margin. Unlike the notas in most medieval manuscripts, which were
generally symbols, these nota marks are written in easily readable
words. The single scribe who copied this manuscript often used symbols
in the texts, such as the moon, sun, and gender symbols (see also VCF
17).
