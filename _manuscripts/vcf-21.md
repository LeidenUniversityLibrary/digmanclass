In the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, the disciplines of
alchemy and [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology) were
closely connected. When you look at the titles of the alchemical texts
in this manuscript you see that many of them concern planets and the
moon, clearly illustrating this connection. It was believed that the
zodiac signs, planets, metals, and elements were all inter-related.
Aries was, for example, believed to be ruled by Mars, and was associated
with the metal iron and the element fire. The symbols of the planets
were often used to denote chemical processes (see also VCF 17).

This manuscript also contains a treatise on the [Philosopher's
Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone) (fol. 1-17),
texts by [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus) (fols.
96-131) and many alchemical and medicinal recipes (fol. 133-354). The
scribe of this manuscript was Hans Meissel, who also copied VCF 6, VCF
13 and VCF 14. The readers' annotations are very minimal, and the
manuscript does not look heavily used. The original binding has,
however, suffered some damage. The leather strips on the binding were
used to tie the book closed.
