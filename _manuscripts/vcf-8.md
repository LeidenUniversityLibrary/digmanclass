"***Praesentem monstrat quaelibet herba Deum***" (Any blade of grass
points to the presence of God). This quote from poet [Johannes
Stigelius](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Stigel) (1515-1562)
begins this alchemical manuscript from 1585 (see "*anno MDLXXXV"* fol.
1r). The quote possibly served as a reminder to the reader that the
various (al)chemical recipes in this manuscript should be used to honor
God and not for personal profit (see also VCF 11). Not every text in
this manuscript is about alchemy, though. The manuscript starts with a
dialogue between Prometheus and Zeus written by [Lucian of
Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian) (c. 125 AD -- 180 AD), a
Syrian satirist and rhetorician. Another text Lucian is known for is his
*Dialogues of the Gods*, in which he mocks the Greek gods. *Dialogues* was
translated into Latin in 1518.

The annotations in this manuscript are minimal. Someone, either the
scribe or one of the readers, tipped in a small piece of paper (now fol.
330) in order to add a diagram to a text on the *practica abbatis* (The
monk's practica) by pseudo-Aquinas.\* Fol. 253r - 255v contains a text on
a formula that was used by king Philip IV of France.
