This little manuscript contains parts of the *[Fasciculus
medicinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciculus_Medicinae);* a
compilation of six medieval medical treatises. Even though only two
manuscripts with this compilation ever existed, the popularity of the
*Fasciculus medicinae* increased tremendously once it was printed in
1491, as it had the distinction of being the first illustrated medical
work to appear in print. This manuscript is a copy of one of the printed
editions. The illustrations in this manuscript are quite rough in
comparison to the woodcuts in the printed versions, but they are still
recognizable.

The illustration on fol. <span data-fol="9r" class="fref">9r</span> depicts the body of a stoic looking figure
covered with cuts and bruises inflicted by knives, daggers and arrows.
This figure was known as a "[wound
man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_Man)". Treatments for these
various injuries are described in the margin of the page. Other
illustrations in this manuscript depict which veins could be used for
blood-letting (fol. <span data-fol="3v" class="fref">3v</span>), how to find cures for various diseases (fol. <span data-fol="12v" class="fref">12v</span>), and how to interpret the color of urine (fol. <span data-fol="1v" class="fref">1v</span>). The scribe of
this manuscript was apparently quite interested in that last topic, as
he also added one Latin and two Dutch treatises on urinalysis.
