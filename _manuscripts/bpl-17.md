This manuscript contains the first fully recognizable dictionary from
the Middle Ages, the *Elementarium,* and was written by lexicographer
[Papias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_(lexicographer)) in the
first half of the eleventh century. Papias arranged the words in
alphabetical order, provided their definition and noted their vowel
length and gender. Papias made use of the writings of many famous
scholars such as Boethius, Priscian, and Isidore of Seville, whom he
often quotes. In some cases, he copied excerpts from textbooks and
glossaries.

This manuscript also contains Papias' *Ars grammatica* (a survey of
Latin grammar), the *Mythologiae* by
[Fulgentius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Planciades_Fulgentius),
glosses on the Bible, and other texts on grammar and
[etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology). In the
*Mythologiae,* Fulgentius tries to explain and interpret a series of
Greek and Roman legends by using allegory and etymology. Much like the
other texts in this manuscript, it is probable that the *Mythologiae*
was used by students to gain a better understanding of the meaning of
the Latin language.

Each letter of the alphabet within this manuscript is introduced with a
pen-flourished or colored initial. Lines that are not fully occupied by
script are filled in with red decorations, called line fillers (see for
example fol. 67v).[^1]
