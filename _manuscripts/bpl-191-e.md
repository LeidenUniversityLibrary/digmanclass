The date on which [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus) is
celebrated depends on the phase of the moon in relation to the Spring
Equinox, and therefore varies year-to-year. Determining the date of
Easter required profound knowledge on astronomy, especially the lunar
calendar. In 1171 Reinherus of Paderborn (c. 1140-c. 1190) published the
*Computus emendatus* (Corrected Computation) in which he proposed a
corrected table with the Easter dates, as he had determined that the
currently-accepted dates were flawed. Paderborn claimed, for example,
that Easter was celebrated three days too late in 1171.

The *Computus emendatus* is one of the eight texts in this manuscript.
It also contains excerpts on grammar and astronomy, glosses on the
Bible, and letters from [Ivo of Chartres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_of_Chartres). The different
texts were bound together some time later, resulting in a variety of
lay-outs throughout the manuscript. In the margins of the first part of
this manuscript (fols. <span data-fol="1r" class="fref">1r</span> - <span data-fol="60v" class="fref">60v</span>) you can see unusual marks, known as
*nota bene*[^1] markings, on almost every leaf. If you look closely you
can see that each drawing is a monogram of the letters n, o, t, and a.
Nota bene markings vary in appearance from page to page.
