Have you ever wondered what a classical author looked like? Someone,
either the scribe or a future reader, tried to illustrate this by
drawing a portrait of [Statius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statius)
on fol. <span data-fol="213v" class="fref">213v</span>. Unfortunately, his or her artistic skills leave much to be
desired - Statius' only recognizable trait is his laurel wreath. The
same "artist" tried to draw another portrait on fol. <span data-fol="238v" class="fref">238v</span>, but it was
never finished.

This composite manuscript consists of eight parts. As the leaves of the
parts were being trimmed to the same size, the commentary of the first
part (fols. <span data-fol="1r" class="fref">1r</span> - <span data-fol="36v" class="fref">36v</span>) was partly cut off. As a result, only the
first lines of the commentary are still visible. In the early fifteenth
century the complete manuscript belonged to the Convent of St. James in
Liege. They already owned the seventh part, containing a commentary on
[Boethius'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius) *De consolatione philosophiae* (The Consolation of Philosophy), in the early fourteenth
century, the rest was added later. *De consolatione philosophiae* was
one of the most influential philosophical text of the Middle Ages. The
fact that the convent in Liege already owned this part makes it
plausible that this convent was also responsible for the compilation of
this composite manuscript.
