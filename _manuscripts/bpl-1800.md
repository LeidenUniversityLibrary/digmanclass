This manuscript contains a Dutch [History
Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Historiale). It differs from
other Bibles written in the
[vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) in that History
Bibles are not close translations of the standard Latin version of the
Bible at the time, called the
[Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate). Instead, they are
loose adaptations of the Vulgate combined with information from other
works, intentionally written in an easy-to-read narrative style. There
are two Dutch History Bibles that originated independently from each
other. This manuscript contains the so-called "Second History Bible".
Its contents are based on the Vulgate, [Jacob van
Maerlant'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_van_Maerlant)s
*Rijmbijbel* (Versified Bible), and Petrus Comestor's *Historica scholastica.*

This particular manuscript, which contains numerous rubrics[^1] as well as
colored initials, consists of two parts. The first part dates to 1530,
the second part to 1459. From fol. 128 onward this manuscript differs
from other manuscripts that contain the Second History Bible. It is
likely that the scribe copied this part of the manuscript from another
source that was a closer translation of the Vulgate. At the end of the
text (fol. 245r) the scribe writes *"Et sic est finis MCCC XXII"*,
claiming that he finished this book in 1322. Did he inadvertently copy
the date from the manuscript he used as his exemplar, or did he write it
on purpose, hoping to convince people that this manuscript was also from
an earlier time?
