The scribe of this manuscript wrote at fol. 141v that she finished
writing it in 1533 and that it belonged to the "*witte nonnen*" of
Leiden. The so-called white nuns were members of the
[Dominican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order) Convent of
the Virgin at the Rapenburg in Leiden (Netherlands). The chapel of this
convent was taken over by by the University of Leiden in 1581 and has
been used as academic building ever since. Many street names in the
vicinity of the University still refer to nuns that once lived in this
area.

This manuscript contains Dutch translations of
[homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily) (commentary that
follows a reading of scripture) by several Christian authors, including
Bede, Augustine and John Chrysostom. The scribe has copied these
homilies from the first book of Collationes by Dirc van Herxen (see also
BPL 2231). The first pages of the manuscript contain many reader's
annotations. At fol. 188r, 188v, and 190v you can see drawings of small
hands pointing to specific sentences in the text. These hands, called
*manicula*[^1], show the reader which passages deserve extra attention and
appear often in medieval manuscripts. The shape of the hand and the
number of fingers visible varied from manuscript to manuscript.
