[Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) is the science that
studies celestial objects such as stars, planets and galaxies. In the
Middle Ages astronomy and astrology (the study that tries to divine
information about human affairs from the position of celestial objects)
were closely connected and often studied together. Astronomy was an
important subject for the Catholic Church, especially for determining
the correct date of Easter, which is celebrated on the Sunday after the
first full moon of spring. This manuscript contains an excerpt of
[Bede's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede) *De temporibus*. *De temporibus* introduces the principles of the
[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus); the calculation
system to determine the dates of Easter for every year.

In addition to *De temporibus* this manuscript contains excerpts of and
a commentary on Priscian*'s Institutiones* (see also BPL 186), as well
as several medical recipes. The different parts were bound together at a
later date, which explains the variation of the subjects of the texts.
In the last part, containing the commentary on the *Institutiones,* you
can see the difference between the flesh side and the hair side of the
parchment.\* The hair side is darker than the flesh side and carries
speckled traces of the hair follicles.
