The [Book of Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours) was one
of the most popular books in the later Middle Ages, especially amongst
lay people. Members of the clergy, however, used a
[Breviarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breviary) for their daily
prayers. The Breviarium did not only contain the liturgy of hours but
also prayers for specific holy days, a choir psalter and litanies. Just
as Books of Hours, breviaries contained a calendar of saints. From the
saints that are mentioned on these calendars it is often possible to
locate the origin of the manuscript. On f.4r in this manuscript we find
a reference to the feast day of Saint Gertrud on March 17 'in hac domo
buscodis' This tells us that the manuscript was produced in or for the
convent of St. Gertrudis in 's --Hertogenbosch. This convent was famous
for a miraculous image of the Virgin. The nuns of the convent were
mainly women of noble birth.\
The decoration of this manuscript is unique; there are no other known
examples of the type of pen-flourished initials that are used in this
manuscript. On f.86r the illuminator has drawn the head of an animal and
on f.137r he has drawn a bird. Even though there are almost no
annotations in this manuscript, someone has added some staff-lines with
musical notes in the margin (see f.52v, f.72v and f.186r).
