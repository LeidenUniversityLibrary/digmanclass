Most alchemical treatises contain cryptic symbols that denote alchemical
elements, compounds and processes. The sun and moon, for example, are
symbols of the metals gold and silver. Some manuscripts offer the reader
a table with the explanation of these symbols, but in most cases they
are regarded as common knowledge. There are several theories that
explain the use of symbols in alchemical treatises. Some people believed
that alchemical knowledge was so powerful and difficult that it should
be hidden from "unworthy" people who did not have an alchemical
background. Another possibility is that not all alchemists understood
the complicated recipes and experiments and therefore resorted to the
use of symbols.

This sixteenth-century manuscript starts with a list of symbols and
their explanations. Some of these symbols are used throughout the book.
The manuscript contains various alchemical texts, such as the tenth
volume of [Paracelsus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus) *De gradationibus* (pp.
<span data-fol="13" class="fref">13</span> - <span data-fol="22" class="fref">22</span>) and several recipes.

The text on altimetry between pp. <span data-fol="209" class="fref">209</span> -
<span data-fol="217" class="fref">217</span> was added later on. The
elaborate drawings in this text illustrate how to measure various
heights.
