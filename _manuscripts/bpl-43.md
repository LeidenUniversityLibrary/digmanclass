[Virgil's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil) *Aeneid*, in which he
describes the story of the Trojan war hero Aeneas, is probably the most
popular Latin poem of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The text was used
as a textbook of Latin from at least the second century AD. Even
contemporary students of Latin are often encouraged to study the poem,
along with the *[Aeneid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil)*, which
is also contained within this manuscript. The numerous glosses[^1],
especially those in the beginning of the manuscript, show us how
thoroughly this particular text was studied. The manuscript is
considered a "holster book", owing to its dimensions of 307 x 183 mm.
This tells us that it was probably used by a teacher (see also BPL 137
D). The unusual, oblong, size was convenient for teachers, as the books
could easily be held in one hand while walking through the classroom.

The manuscript consists of two parts. The first part was written in the
eleventh century and ends with verse 3.116. The second part was written
in the twelfth century and is a continuation starting at verse 3.117.
This part was probably added to replace text that was lost. The
lay-out[^2] of the two sections are very different from one another, even
though they have the same size leaves. The text of the first part was
written in one column of 30 lines, while the second part was written in
two columns with 62 lines, making both parts independent codicological
units. The colors of the decorated initials are, however, quite similar.
