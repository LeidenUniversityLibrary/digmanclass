From the Early Middle Ages until the end of the Renaissance, books known
as ["mirrors for
princes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes) were very
popular. In this type of book, the author speaks directly to a sovereign
and gives him advice about his rule and his behavior. Mirrors for
princes were often written when a young and inexperienced ruler came
into power. This manuscript contains part of the mirror for princes that
was written by [Jacob van
Maerlant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_van_Maerlant)
(1230/1240-c. 1288). He probably wrote it for the then twelve-year-old
[Floris V, Count of
Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floris_V,_Count_of_Holland)
(1254-1296). Van Maerlant not only gives political and moral advice but
also instructions for health, hygiene, and information about natural
science.

This manuscript also contains three parts of another famous work by Van
Maerlant: *De Rijmbijbel* (the Bible in Rhyme, see also LTK 168). This
Bible was based on [Petrus
Comestors'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Comestor) *Historica
scholastica.* The manuscript contains both medieval and early modern
parts. The modern parts, one and three (fols. 1-3, fols. 7-20), are
written on paper\*, while parts two and four, written between 1300 and
1325 (fol. 4, fols. 21-26), were copied on parchment.\*
