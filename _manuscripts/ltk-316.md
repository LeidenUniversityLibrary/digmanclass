Not everything that was written by early Christians about the life of
Jesus and his teachings ended up in the canon of the New Testament.
However, some of these texts, called the
[*Apocrypha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha), were
very popular in the Middle Ages. This manuscript contains the Dutch
translation of the apocryphal [Gospel of
Nicodemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Nicodemus). The
gospel not only describes Jesus' trial and Crucifixion but also his
descent into hell. Though the official New Testament does not mention
this period in hell, the story very much appealed to people in the
Middle Ages. Many painters have drawn inspiration from this text and
have depicted this scene in their work. The manuscript also includes a
description of Jesus' outward appearance, the five times he had bled in
his life, and the five times he had cried.

These detailed texts about the [Passion of
Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_of_Jesus) were created to
help the reader to contemplate Christ's suffering. They were popular
with monks and nuns as well as lay people, who could use them to
contemplate Christ's death at home.

This manuscript is decorated with both pen-flourished and colored
initials. The word *passio* (suffering) is written in red ink,
presumably in order to emphasize the suffering of Christ.
