This manuscript was completed by the scribe Peter Jünger on December
8th, 1586. We know this from the colophon on fol. <span data-fol="152v" class="fref">152v</span> where he wrote
"*Laus deo Gloria* (Praise and Glory to God) *Anno Christi 1568 8 Decembris*." Jünger used two kinds of script to copy the texts in the
manuscript: Gothic cursive and Humanistic cursive. On fol. <span data-fol="30v" class="fref">30v</span> you can
see the transition from Gothic to Humanistic. One of the texts in this
manuscript is *Alchemia et remediorum liber* (The Book of Alchemy and
Medicine). The manuscript also contains a text on wine, beer, and
vinegar, in addition to recipes and philosophical treatises.

Both the paper leaves and the binding of this manuscript were produced
in [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden), Germany. Paper was
introduced in Europe in the twelfth century, though it was not until the
late thirteenth century that it was used in book production. Bindings
were, however, still made from animal skin - in this case a calf's. This
binding was produced in 1590 (four years after the manuscript was
finished) in the workshop of Jakob Weidlich. He also produced the
bindings of VCF 17, VCF 18, VCF 21 and VCF 23.
