Much like [books of hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours)
and [breviaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breviary), books
containing the [Passion of
Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel) were very popular in
the Late Middle Ages. Passion books provided a guide for the
contemplation of Christ's suffering. Often, they gave a more detailed
version of the Passion of Jesus than the Gospels in the Bible. This
manuscript contains, for example, a text about the fifteen times Christ
shed blood during his life. Passion books were not only popular with
monks and nuns but also with lay people, who used them to meditate on
Christ's death at home. The saints that are mentioned in the calendar at
the beginning of the manuscript, combined with the dialect used, confirm
that this Passion book was written for a citizen of the Flemish city
[Tongeren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongeren).

This manuscript is decorated with colored and pen-flourished initials.
The historiated initial[^1] 'O' on fol. <span data-fol="156r" class="fref">156r</span> depicts the five wounds that
Jesus suffered during the crucifixion. Fol. <span data-fol="222v" class="fref">222v</span> once contained a
pasted-on miniature, and although it has since been removed you can
still see the where the miniature was once pasted to the leaf.
