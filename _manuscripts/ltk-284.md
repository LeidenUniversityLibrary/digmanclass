The religious movement called *[Devotio moderna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devotio_Moderna)* (Modern
Devotion) took root in the Low Countries in the late fourteenth century.
The movement, which called for religious reform, had a major following
amongst both the laity and the clergy. The founder of the *Devotio moderna* was teacher and theologian [Geert
Groote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Groote). Groote wrote and
preached in both Latin and Dutch. Towards the end of his life he started
translating important religious texts into Dutch. Many lay people wanted
to read these texts but were not able to because they could not read
Latin. This manuscript contains Groote's translation of the
[book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours) of hours, a resource
for private devotion. His translation was so popular that it is found in
nearly all Dutch copies of the book of hours.

An owner from the eighteenth century has added a table of contents\* to
the first flyleaf. The manuscript begins with a calendar of the
bishopric of Utrecht (p. 1), followed by prayers and hymns (p. 25), and
lastly, the hours (pp. 123-474). The manuscript is decorated with
pen-flourished initials in green, red and blue. The leaves are dark with
staining, probably due to water damage.
