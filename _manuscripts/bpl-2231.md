Each Sunday and holy day the [Brethren of the Common
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life) held
conversations with pious laypeople to educate them about religious
subjects. In search for inspiration for these conversations, which were
called *collationes,* they could consult the \'Collatieboeken\'. Dirc
van Herxen (1381-1457) one of the foremen of the [Modern
Devotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devotio_Moderna) movement and a
famous scribe and illuminator, composed two *collatieboeken*. Van Herxen
wrote about subjects such as death, the last judgment, heaven, hell, sin
and confessions. He retrieved the material for his Collatieboeken from
the Bible, patristic writings and his own publications. Brethren of the
Common Life could easily look up the various subjects in the table of
contents (see f.3v).\
Only one of the two Collatieboeken of Dirc van Herxen has survived
intact. It is held by the University Library of Utrecht (UB 3 L 6). This
manuscript from Leiden only contains the second half of the first book
of *collationes* containing *Die Materie van den Sonden* \[the Topic of
Sins\]. It belonged to the convent of the Virgin in Gaesdonck in the
fifteenth century (see f.3v and see also BPL 2482 and BPL 2483). The
manuscript has very few decorations and the parchment is damaged on
several leaves. Readers of this book have used different methods to
correct passages of the text. There are, however, not many readers'
annotations.
