Whenever a person entered a convent he or she made a vow to obey to the
rules of the order. Many convents followed the Rule of St. Benedict. The
'[*Regula
Benedicti*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)' was
the most popular monastic rule in the Middle Ages. It underlined the
importance obedience, poverty and modesty. Moreover, it offered a guide
for daily life in the monasteries. The Rule of St. Benedict divided the
day in periods of prayer, sleep, reading and labor. The part of this
manuscript that contains the Rule of St. Benedict was directed at nuns,
while other texts in this manuscript are directed at monks. The
different parts of the manuscript have their own lay-out and show the
hands of different scribes. Just as BPL 2231 and BPL 2482 this book
belonged to the convent of the Virgin in Gaesdonck.\
The parchment flyleaves of this manuscript were taken from a
[psalter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalter) from the eight century.
Whenever a scribe was in need of parchment he or she often used a piece
from an older manuscript to reduce the total costs. Even though it is a
shame that many manuscripts have not survived because they were re-used,
sometimes the fragments are still readable and can be studied. The
manuscript still has its original binding; a limp binding made from
parchment and without wooden cover boards. The binding is, however,
badly damaged by water. Water damage is especially visible in the first
few pages of the manuscript.
