The [*Ad herennium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium) and
the *De inventione* were the two most influential study texts about
[rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) in the Middle Ages.
For a long time both texts were ascribed to Cicero, but today only *De inventione* is attributed to him. Both texts provide practical
applications and examples of rhetoric which focus on style, memorization
and the composition of arguments. *De inventione* is the first text in
which the term "Liberal Arts" was used. As with many study books on
rhetoric, this manuscript contains both texts, though originally they
were bound together in a different order.

This manuscript is decorated with colored initials. Both texts contain
glosses[^1] in the margin and between the lines. Most of the commentary in
the margin is lost because the leaves were trimmed when the manuscript
was rebound. The annotations in the second part, containing the *De
inventione,* were written by several people. One reader has marked
important passages on fol. <span data-fol="44v" class="fref">44v</span> and fol. <span data-fol="48v" class="fref">48v</span> by drawing little hands
(*maniculae*, see also BPL 197). The last leaf of the manuscript, fol. <span data-fol="88r" class="fref">88</span>, contains various scribbles and was probably used to test the pen of
the scribe (see also BPL 139 B).
