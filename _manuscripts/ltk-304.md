Most [books of hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours)
contain not only the [Divine
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy_of_the_Hours) but also
prayers for other occasions. One of the prayers in this book of hours is
focuses on the "sweet name of Jesus" which, according to the rubric[^1],
was supposed to prevent or cure the plague. The prayer was composed by
[Bernardino of Siena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_of_Siena)
(1380-1444), an Italian priest who worked for several months in the
hospital of Siena, taking care those infected by the plague.

This book of hours is written in both Latin and Dutch. Since most lay
people (and many nuns) were unable to read Latin it was probably owned
by a monastery with male members, most likely from the order of
Augustine (see the prayer to "our dear father St. Augustine" at fol. <span data-fol="147v" class="fref">147v</span>). The monks could have used this book of hours either during the
Divine Office or during personal meditation. By listing January 8^th^ as
the feast day of St. Goedele in the manuscript's calendar we are given
another hint as to where this book was produced. It is believed that
this manuscript originated in the vicinity of Brussels (Belgium), since
the relics of St. Goedele were transferred to the cathedral in Brussels
in the eleventh century.
