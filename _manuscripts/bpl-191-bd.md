Young children today often use their fingers to count. As they get
older, they can solve mathematical problems without their fingers, often
aided by the calculators on their cellphones. However, during the Middle
Ages finger counting was used by even the most experienced
mathematicians. People were able to count to a thousand, just by using
their two hands. The numbers 1-99 were counted on the left hand, while
the numbers 100-9999 were counted on the right. Fol. 4r in this
manuscript depicts an illustration of how to count on your fingers
according to the method used at the time.

The illustration is part of [Hrabanus Maurus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabanus_Maurus) *De computo* (On
Calculation). The text is written as a dialog between a teacher and
student who ask each other questions about the
*[computus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus)* system (see also
BPL 154). Maurus' text on calculation was frequently copied in
schoolbooks, owing to its accessible way of presenting information. Like
the drawings on finger counting, these tools were probably meant to
aid\* the students with their own calculations.
