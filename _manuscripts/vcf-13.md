Manuscripts were often used by a variety of readers. The first reader of
this manuscript, the person for whom the manuscript was produced, was
[Sebald Schwertzer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebalt_Schwertzer)
(1552-1598), a German merchant and alchemist who worked at the court of
Dresden. We know this because he wrote his name on fol. 57r. In the
beginning of the seventeenth century this manuscript came into the
possession of [Christina, Queen of
Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden)
(1626-1689), who was an avid collector of manuscripts. The Dutch scholar
[Isaac Vossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Vossius)
(1618-1689), who worked as librarian at her court, helped the queen
expand her collection, for which he received several manuscripts as
payment. All the manuscripts in this theme whose signature starts with
the letters VCF belonged to this collection.

This manuscript, which was copied by two different scribes, contains
treatises on alchemy and medical recipes, and includes several letters.
The name of the scribe who wrote fols. 1r-166v is Hans Meissel, who also
copied VCF 6, VCF 14 and VCF 21. The text on fols. 176r-178v is about
necromancy: a practice that teaches communication with the deceased as a
means to foretell the future or discover hidden knowledge. Many people
regarded necromancy as black magic and not as a real science.
