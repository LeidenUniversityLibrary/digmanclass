After you have turned the first twenty-six empty paper leaves at the
beginning of this manuscript, a text from the third volume of *De
viribus memborum* (The strength of the organs/limbs) begins. This book
was written by Theophrastus von Hohenheim (1493/1494-1541), better known
as [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus). Paracelsus
was a controversial physician, alchemist and astrologer who pioneered
the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine. He was one of the first
physicians who believed that members of his profession should have an
academic background in natural sciences and chemistry.

This manuscript contains several texts by Paracelsus on both medical and
alchemical topics. It also contains a treatise on the Philosopher's
Stone by [Isaac
Hollandius](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Isaac_Hollandus) (see
VCQ 37) and short passages on alchemical recipes and experiments. Fol.
9v, for example, describes a remedy to treat snake bites. Fol. 10r
contains an improved recipe against epilepsy. Until the nineteenth
century, this manuscript had a parchment cover\* made from an official
document from 1473.

The texts were written by five different scribes. Scribe A (fols. 1-56,
94-100) is particularly hard to read because of the thick pen-strokes
and the ink that has leaked through to the other side of the leaves.
