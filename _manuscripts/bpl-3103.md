When someone wanted to know which medicinal properties were ascribed to
a certain plant or herb, a
[herbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal) could be consulted. This
reference book contains drawings of plants and herbs, information about
their properties, and medicinal recipes. In the Middle Ages, books like
these were often used by monks, who had access to various plants in
their [garden](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kloostertuin). They were
also used by students, doctors and apothecaries. Herbals gained even
more popularity towards the end of the Middle Ages, when increasingly
more people became literate. In addition to serving medicinal purposes,
herbals were often consulted for recipes during meal preparation.

This herbal was written in South Germany. Originally the manuscript only
contained paintings of the plants and their names. The extensive
commentary in German, Latin, and Czech was added later, in the
seventeenth century. The person who drew these plants did not copy them
from another manuscript but based them on real plants from his
neighborhood, which scholars today know are plants indigenous to
Bohemia. The herbal was probably created for the personal use of a
doctor or apothecary.
