The practice of copying texts by hand in notebooks for personal use
remained popular even after the invention of the book press. This
manuscript is a modern example of a handwritten grammar book from the
eighteenth century. It belonged to and was written by the Dutch
historian and jurist [Petrus Bondam](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn2/bondam)
(1727-1800). Bondam wrote multiple studies on Latin grammar. This
manuscript was written for his personal use and was not published. It
contains [Aldhelm\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldhelm) *De metris*
and *De pedum regulis liber,* two writings on poetry and two fragments
on Latin grammar. Aldhelm was a famous
[Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) scholar and
poet whose writings were often used in monastic schools.

This manuscript has a very different lay-out than medieval manuscripts
and early printed books (see LTK 237). For example, it does not contain
rubrics or any decorated initials. Apart from a few annotations, each
leaf is empty on the verso side. Bondam could have either copied these
annotations from the exemplar he used or added them himself as he
studied the text. One anotation can still be found in Bondam's version;
he did copy the catchwords\* in the bottom right corner.
