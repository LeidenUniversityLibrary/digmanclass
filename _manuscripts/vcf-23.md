The [*Secretum secretorum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretum_Secretorum) (The
Secret of Secrets) was one of the most widely read texts amongst
intellectuals in the High Middle Ages. The text was believed to be a
letter written by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)
to [Alexander the
Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great). Nowadays
scholars think that the Secret of Secrets was more than likely written
by an unknown tenth-century Arabic author. The *Secretum secretorum*
discusses topics such as: ethics, astrology, alchemy, magic and
medicine. The famous scholar [Roger
Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon) often cited from this
text and has added his own extensive glosses. In 1266 Jacob van Maerlant
translated the text into Middle Dutch (see *De heimelijkheid der heimelijkheden* LTK 169).

This manuscript contains part of the *Secretum secretorum* (fol. 20-41)
and various other alchemical treatises. It is copied by six different
scribes and written in German, Latin, and Greek. Fols. 144v- 145v
contains horoscopes from January 9th, 1506 and January 12th, 1507.
Just as many of the other manuscripts in this theme, this one was owned
by Sebald Schwertzer, [Queen Christina of
Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden), and
[Isaac Vossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Vossius).
