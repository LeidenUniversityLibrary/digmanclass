At the end of the Middle Ages increasingly more lay people were drawn to
the religious life of the clergy. They also wanted to come closer to God
by praying daily and doing spiritual exercises. The first part of this
manuscript contains one of the most popular meditation texts of the
Middle Ages directed at lay people: [Henry Suso's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Suso) *Das BÃ¼chlein der
ewigen Weisheit* (The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom). This book is an
adaptation of the Passion of Jesus divided in one hundred meditations.
After every five or ten meditations follows a corresponding prayer.
Suso's adaptation of the Passion of Jesus varies strongly with the
adaptation of the Passion by [Jacob van Maerlant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_van_Maerlant) (see ...).
Suso, for example, does not even mention the crucifixion because he
regarded it as common knowledge. The purpose of these meditations were
to have compassion with the suffering of Christ.
The second part of this manuscript consists of psalms, a litany and
prayers. The two parts were bound together in the sixteenth century.
Around that time the manuscript belonged the convent of St. Bernard in
Antwerp (see the note of administrator Livinius de Smedt on f.1r.). The
manuscript is beautifully decorated with painted initials. F.14r
contains a historiated initial of two angels who cover Christ with a
blanket. At the end of each quire at the bottom of the page you can see
catchwords (the first word of the new quire) which made it easier for
the binder to put the quires in the right order. In the second part of
the manuscript, the catchwords are almost cut off in the binding
process.
