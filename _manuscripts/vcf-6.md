Throughout the history of alchemy there was one legendary substance that
almost all alchemists searched for: the [Philosopher's
Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher's_stone). It was
believed that this substance was able to turn base metals into gold or
silver, heal people from all sorts of illnesses, and even offer
immortality for the people who consumed part of it. Philosopher and
scientist [Albertus
Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus) (c.
1193-1280) had, according to legend, discovered the Philosopher's Stone
and passed it on to Thomas Aquinas. Most manuscripts that are included
in this theme, including this one, contain one or more treatises on this
famous substance.

Fols. 12r - 34v contains the text "*Vom Stein der Weisen*" (The Stone of
the Wise). The manuscript also contains other alchemical texts from
authors such as [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon)
and GÃ©ber. The text in fol. 1 deals with
[exorcism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism); the practice of
casting out demons from a person who is believed to be possessed. The
scribe of this manuscript was Hans Meissel, who also copied VCF 13, 14
and 21. The first reader of this book was probably alchemist Sebald
Schwertzer (1552-1598). In the seventeenth century it came into the
possession of [Christina, Queen of
Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden)
(1626-1689) and the Dutch scholar [Isaac
Vossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Vossius) (1618-1689, see
also VCF 13).
