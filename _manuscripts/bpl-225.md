The final stage of manuscript production is the binding\* of the quires.
Much like today, not every manuscript created during the Middle Ages was
bound in a hard cover. Some manuscripts even remained as loose quires or
were only wrapped in a limp parchment cover. The two parts of this
manuscript that were copied in the Convent of Fleury (see also BPL 139
B) were bound together and wrapped in a discarded French charter to
protect it from harm. In 1949 this manuscript received a modern cover
and the charter was transferred with other former covers to a folder
with the signature BPL 2513.

The first part of this manuscript contains eighteen leaves from *[De astronomica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Astronomica),* which was
allegedly written by Roman historian [Gaius Julius Hyginus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Hyginus). It
describes the Ptolemaic constellations and the Greek and Roman myths
they inspired. The empty squares on the leaves suggest that the text was
intended to be decorated with diagrams or illustrations. The first part
of the manuscript also contains other excerpts on astronomy by
[Aratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus) (315 BC - 240 BC) and
[Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) (AD 23 - 79). The second part of the manuscript contains [Julian of Toledo's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_of_Toledo) (642 -- 690)
*Prognosticon future saeculi,* a text about the end of the world.
