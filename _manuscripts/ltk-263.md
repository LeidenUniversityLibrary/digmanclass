The tale of [St. Ursula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ursula) and
the 11,000 virgins is one of the most popular legends in the later
Middle Ages. It tells the story of St. Ursula, who was murdered by the
Huns in Cologne together with the 11,000 virgins who had accompanied her
on her pilgrimage. Allegedly, the bones of these women were found in
Cologne in 1106. Soon after this discovery, many
[relics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic) of the virgins were
transferred to churches all throughout Europe. The relics of St.
Basilia, one of the 11,000 virgins, were donated to the Convent of
MariÃ«nhaven in Warmond (Netherlands) in the beginning of the fifteenth
century.

This particular convent owned a manuscript -- donated by the Leiden
citizen Willem Heeman -- that contains the *[Legenda Aurea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend) (The Golden Legend)*
by [Jacobus de
Voragine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_da_Varagine) (see also
LTK 278). This text is credited for making popular the legend of St.
Ursula. De Voragine only briefly discusses St. Basilia in the *Legenda
Aurea,* but a member of the convent added two leaves to the back of the
manuscript with more information about her life (fols. 177r - 178v). The
manuscript contains rubrics and is decorated with colored initials.
