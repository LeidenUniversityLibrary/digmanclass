Where some alchemical manuscripts solely contain texts that describe
chemical processes, the texts in this manuscript are also concerned with
the esoteric and philosophical teachings of
[Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah). Kabbalah, originally
a Jewish mystic discipline, tries to comprehend the relationship between
the universe and God. Practitioners of Kabbalah believe that every
letter, word and number in the
[Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible), the canon of
Hebrew scriptures, contains hidden messages.

The fourth text of this manuscript is the third volume of [Johannes
Trithemius'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius)
*Steganographia.* This volume, believed to be about magic, was placed on
the "List of Prohibited Books" in 1609. The texts describe how spirits
can be used to communicate over long distances. Fol. 76r and fol. 76v
contain a list of the thirty-one so-called Aerial Spirits, also known as
[jinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn). The first column lists the
names of these spirits, the second column shows their symbols and the
third, fourth and fifth columns list how many lesser spirits were under
their command. The Aerial Spirits were associated with [King
Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon), which possibly explains
why this manuscript also contains a treatise on the Song of Songs, a
Biblical text that is sometimes ascribed to Solomon. It includes
additional texts on alchemy and astronomy.
