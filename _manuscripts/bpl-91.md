The margins of this twelfth-century manuscript contain many glosses.
They were added in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth-centuries,
and show how this manuscript passed from one owner to the next, several
of whom wrote their names on fol. <span data-fol="175v" class="fref">175v</span>. The note at the bottom of the
page reads that this manuscript belonged to the "commune bonorum
puerorum", the "society of honorable boys", in the fourteenth century.
The boys of this society probably used this manuscript to study
[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar), as it
contains
[Priscian's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscian)
*Institutiones grammaticae* (Institutes of Grammar) -- a text that was
very popular amongst advanced students of grammar at the time (See also
BPL 186).

The manuscript is decorated with beautifully colored initials.
Unfortunately, the first leaves of the manuscript were partly eaten by
rodents. The flyleaves at the back of the manuscript are made from badly
damaged parchment[^1] (see the holes and the stitches). Scribes have used
the first page of these flyleaves to test their pens by scribbling down
words and symbols. The rusty brown stain in the middle of this page
probably covers an owner mark. The following two pages of the flyleaves
were used in the fourteenth century to add more glosses. Someone has
even added a remark in Hebrew.
