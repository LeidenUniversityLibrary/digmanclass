This manuscript consists of three independent material units, which were
produced at different times and places and then later bound together.
During the binding process the leaves were cut to the same size, which
led to some loss of the text in the third part. Upon close inspection
you can see that someone added the missing letters some time later (see
fol. 66v as an example).

The first part of this manuscript (fol. 1r-53v) contains a
[psalter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalter) and various prayers.
This part once belonged to a Dominican monastery in Zwolle (the
Netherlands). The second part consists of two sermons for the feast day
of [St. Barbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Barbara). The third
part, however, is perhaps the most interesting part of this manuscript.
It contains a hymnal owned and written by Marigen Remen, who was from
either Leiden or Amsterdam (see fol. 65v). Even though her script is
rough and her grammar poor the text is easy to read.

The red dots on each page are added as decoration to fill up the
interlinear spacing and are not to be mistaken for musical notes. Most
books of songs produced in the second half of the sixteenth century were
no longer witten by hand but printed.
