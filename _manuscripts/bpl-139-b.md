The [Trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium) of the Liberal Arts
consisted of three subjects: grammar,
[rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) and dialectic (also
called logic). [Dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) is a
method that tries to find the truth by using reasonable arguments to
defend two or more opposite assertions. This manuscript contains,
amongst other texts on logic, the *De syllogisms categoricis,* which was
written by [Abbo of Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbo_of_Fleury) (c. 945-1004)
specifically for students of dialectic. The manuscript was copied by the
Convent of Fleury-St. Benoit in France. Throughout the manuscript we can
find many diagrams. Fol. 31r contains an
[anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism)
initial of a man that is being torn by two lions.

The manuscript has another interesting element - the flyleaf at the back
contains various words and symbols that don't seem to be connected to
the contents of the manuscript. This has an easy explanation; the leaf
was used by the scribe(s) to test the pen\*. Just like a pencil, the nib
of a pen becomes dull after a while. To rectify this, the scribe had to
trim the nib with a knife. Afterwards he tested the pen to check if it
was ready for use by scribbling lines, words, or little drawings.

This flyleaf with pen trials contains a strange drawing of a person, the
name Petrus, and musical notations known as
[neumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neume). (see also BPL 2851).
