One of the most influential Christian authorities in the Middle Ages was
the bishop and philosopher [Augustine of
Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) (354-430). He
is viewed as one of the [Church
fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers) who set the
foundations of Christianity. Between 413 and 426 Augustine wrote the
*[De Civitate Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_God)* \[The
City of God\] in twenty-two books in which he defended Christianity
against the allegation that Christians had been responsible for the
decline of Rome. The books treat subjects such as Greek philosophy, the
Free Will and the doctrine of original sin. Many manuscripts with this
text have survived. The University of Leiden alone has eight manuscripts
with (parts of) the *De Civitate Dei.*
This manuscript contains chapter forty-three of the second book of the
*De Civitate Dei*. As you can see this manuscript has no annotations. It
was therefore probably not used for study purposes. On f.2 we see two
large decorated initials; other pages are decorated with smaller colored
initials in red and blue. The manuscript belonged to the convent of St.
Clara in Amsterdam around 1500, as we can tell from the owner marks on
the flyleaves. The sisters of this convent were expelled from the city
in 1590. After their expulsion the manuscript came in the possession of
Christophorus Dibuadius (c.1578-1621), a Danish scholar studying in
Leiden from 1598. On f.139v you can read the exact date that the scribe
finished copying the text.
