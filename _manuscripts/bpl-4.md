[Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)
(354-430), a bishop and philosopher during the early medieval period, is
viewed as one of the [Fathers of the
Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers); the influential
early Christians who set the foundations for the Christian Faith.
Between 413 and 426, Augustine wrote *[De civitate
Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_God)* (The City of God),
a collection of twenty-two books that defend Christianity against the
allegation that followers of that religion had been responsible for the
decline of Rome. The books encompass several subjects, including Greek
philosophy, the concept of free will, and the doctrine of Original Sin.
A great deal of manuscripts with this text have survived: the Leiden
University Library has eight, each containing a part of *De civitate Dei.*

This manuscript (BPL 4) contains chapter forty-three of the second book
of *De civitate Dei*. As you can see, there are no annotations,
indicating it was probably not used for study purposes. In fol. 2r we
see two large decorated initials[^1], while other pages are decorated with
smaller colored initials in red and blue. We can see from the owner
marks on the flyleaves that this manuscript belonged to the Convent of
St. Clara in Amsterdam around the year 1500, where it remained until
1590 when the sisters of St. Clara were expelled from the city. After
their expulsion, the manuscript came in the possession of Christophorus
Dibuadius (*c*.1578-1621), a Danish scholar studying in Leiden. In fol.
139v you can read the exact date that the scribe finished copying the
text.
