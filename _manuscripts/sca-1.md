Since the third millennium BCE, people have used the
[abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) as a
calculating tool to solve difficult mathematical problems. Even today,
the abacus is still used in primary schools to teach arithmetic to young
children. This manuscript contains a treatise on the use of the abacus,
the *Regulae abaci* (On the Abacus), written by the twelfth-century
English scholar [Adelard of Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelard_of_Bath) (c.
1080 - c. 1152). Adelard translated many important Arabic works on
astronomy and astrology into Latin. These translations, in addition to
Adelard's own publications, were very popular in medieval schools and
universities.

This manuscript once formed the last part of a composite manuscript
containing Alchandreus' *De astrologia* and Boethius' *De aritmethica*
and *De musica.* These four texts were used to study the "quadrivium":
arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy. This copy of the *Regulae abaci* was decorated by an illuminator known as the Virgil Master, who
worked at the court of Jean de Berry from the 1390s to the 1410s. He
added many pen-flourished initials and a beautifully historiated
initial[^1] on fol. 1r. The scribe has also added a form of decoration by
extending the ascending and descending the strokes of some of the
letters of the first and last line of every page.
