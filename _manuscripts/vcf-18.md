When and where a manuscript was written is not always known. The type of
script is an important aid to help determine the production date. In
some cases, scribes wrote down when they completed the manuscript or a
portion of it. Here we see such notations at fols. 1r, 47r, 53v, 155v
and 229v, which shows that the manuscript was written between 1575 and 1586.
An outlier is encountered on fol. 225, where the scribe has
written down "1546 23 Martii MAB" (MAB are the initials of the scribe
Magister Abraham Behem). This particular date could easily have been
copied by accident from the exemplar. This inconsistency in recorded
dates is a good reminder that one should always be careful to not make
automatic assumptions when interpreting a date in a manuscript.

This alchemical manuscript contains *De alchymia libellus* (Booklet on
Alchemy), attributed to [Albertus
Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus) (c. 1200-1280).
Magnus, a German bishop and scholar, wrote about many topics, including
logic, theology, geography, astrology, and alchemy. The manuscript
contains annotations and drawings of [laboratory
glassware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_glassware) and other
chemical equipment that were created by readers. Fols. 152r-154r
contain lists of alchemical symbols (see also VCF 17). One of the
readers also uses these symbols to annotate certain passages.
