This manuscript contains various religious texts written in Latin. It
was owned by the monastery of the Virgin of Bethlehem in Roermond. The
monastery was part of the [Carthusian Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthusians) (see f.1r), the most
strict religious order of Western Europe. Although the monks lived
together in a monastery, they spend most of their time in their private
cells in silence and solitude. The monks were forbidden to speak to each
other, except on sun- and holydays and during their weekly walk. Each
day the monks prayed the [Liturgy of Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy_of_the_Hours) and meditated
on other devotional texts. This manuscript was probably used for private
meditation. The library of the monastery of the Virgin of Bethlehem was
the most important library in the neighborhood of Roermond.\
The pages of this manuscript are rubricated and decorated with colored
initials. Even though most quires of the manuscript consist of paper
leaves, some consist of parchment leaves. On f.42v and f.43r we find a
poem with an interesting layout. Instead of writing the rhyming letters
at the end of each individual line the scribe has written the rhyming
part only once and connected them to the corresponding sentences with
braces. The last sentence of the text has been crossed out in red ink
(see f.163r).
