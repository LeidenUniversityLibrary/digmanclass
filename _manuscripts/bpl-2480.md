When she was just eleven years old, Alijt Baernaertsdochter entered the
convent of MariÃ«npoel in Oegstgeest. This convent was part of the order
of [St. Augustin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinians). In 1528,
when Alijt was 42 years old, she either received or purchased this
prayer book. Prayer books contain prayers and devotional exercises for
specific moments of the day or the year. They were often written in
Dutch because nuns and laypeople were not always able to read Latin.
This prayer book stimulates its reader to contemplate and meditate on
various subjects. On Mondays Alijt was urged to contemplate death.
According to this exercise (see f.1v-f8v.) the contemplation would help
her to refrain from sin. This Monday exercise is followed by exercises
for other days of the week. On Sunday Alijt contemplated the eternal joy
and happiness in heaven. From f.52v this prayer book contains prayers
for various occasions.
We know that the scribe who copied this prayer book was Aernt Janszoon
from the city of Oudewater. On f.91v he wrote "Bidt voer broeder aernt
jans soen van oudewater om goods willen' \[Please pray for friar Aernt
Janszoon of Oudewater for God's sake\]. In contrast to a [Book of Hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours) (see ...)
decorations in this manuscript are modestly executed and few. Only the
first page (see f.2r.) has elaborate decorations and each exercise
starts with a pen-flourished initial. The scribe has added so-called
'cadels' on the letters of the first line of every page. 'Cadels' are
extensions of the ascending and descending strokes of the letters.
