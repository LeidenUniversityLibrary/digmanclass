*Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom* was developed by Erik Kwakkel,
former Scaliger Professor at Leiden University, in collaboration with
[Leiden University Libraries (UBL)][ubl].
The website provides a means to integrate medieval manuscripts in the
classroom through short introductory texts aimed at non-experts.
Integrated questions prompt users to examine certain aspects of the
manuscripts, which are presented in digital form.

All manuscripts presented here were selected from the library’s
Special Collections by Erik Kwakkel with input from instructors at the
University of Leiden’s Faculty of Humanities.
The objects at the heart of Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom were
digitised by Special Collections Services (UBL) with funding made
available by Carel Stolker, Rector Magnificus of Leiden University.

Erik Kwakkel and Renée Schilling organised the manuscripts into educational
routes, while accompanying texts (RS) and a series of questions (EK) were
made to provide a pedagogical context for studying these manuscripts.
The integrated glossary was previously published as
[Quill: Books before Print][quill], a website created by Erik Kwakkel (texts)
and Giulio Menna (photos), now offline.
Further copy-editing of the website was undertaken by Jamie Wood (School of
Information, University of British Columbia).

Ben Companjen ([Centre for Digital Scholarship, UBL][cds]) developed the
website using the [Jekyll static site generator][j] and the
[Minimal Mistakes theme][mm],
in collaboration with Erik Kwakkel, Renée Schilling, and André Bouwman,
curator of western manuscripts (UBL).
The digitised images are presented via [IIIF] from the
[Digital Collections][dc] repository, and shown in the
[Mirador image viewer][mirador].
