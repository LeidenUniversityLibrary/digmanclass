Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom has been developed in a collaborative
effort by the [Scaliger Institute][si], [Centre for Digital Scholarship (CDS)][cds]
and [Special Collections][cbc] at [Leiden University Libraries][ubl].

All manuscripts presented here have been selected from the Libraries' Special
Collections by Erik Kwakkel in his capacity as Scaliger Professor, together with
André Bouwman and Matthijs Holwerda.
The manuscripts have been digitised by Special Collections Services, thanks to
funding provided by the Universiteit Leiden.

The texts accompanying the manuscripts were written by Erik Kwakkel and
Renée Schilling and translated by X.
Erik and Renée also organised the manuscripts into routes.
André helped with wrangling the metadata to create the overviews of manuscripts.

Ben Companjen developed the website using the [Jekyll static site generator][j]
and the [Minimal Mistakes theme][mm], in collaboration with Erik, Renée and André.
The digitised images are served via [IIIF] from the [Digital Collections][dc]
repository, and shown in the [Mirador image viewer][mirador].

The glossary was previously published as Quill.
