*Colorful books* â€“
When the quires were filled with text, the rubrics were in place, and
the scribe had corrected his work, it was time for the finishing
touches. Many medieval books contain some kind of decoration in addition
to the written words, usually executed by a different artisan. There is
a considerable variation in style and quality of decoration, and,
consequently, in cost. At the lower end of the scale is penwork
flourishing, red and blue lines drawn with the pen in various patterns
and shapes. Some of these typify local styles, allowing us to tie a
manuscript to a specific country, city or religious house. At the higher
end of the scale is illumination: often sophisticates little paintings
that included color and often gold. While decorated books stand out
among their other cousins, on the whole they were not very common.
