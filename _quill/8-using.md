Most medieval bookstores were empty because books were too expensive to
have in stock. Instead, each customer would have a long talk with the
shopkeeper, who would ask how much he wanted to spend, what materials he
preferred, what kind of writing style should be used for the text -- and
so on. The medieval book is therefore always one of a kind.

Users often modified the manuscript post-production, bringing it even
more in tune with their needs. Bookmarks were added for quick access to
favorite chapters, while nota signs and maniculae in the margin marked
important passages. Glosses and slips with notes were inserted where the
text needed clarification.
