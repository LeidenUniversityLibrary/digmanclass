*Get set!* â€“
Before a single word flowed from his pen, the scribe needed to prepare
the page. Whether he had opted for a writing supported material, such as
parchment or paper, the sheets were completely blank. He first needed to
think about a sensible layout, carefully considering his options. Did
the text he was about to copy carry certain conventions? Was it for
example a book that was to contain glosses, or was it made for portable
use? The design materialized when the scribe started to punch holes in
the sheet (pricking) and draw lines between pairs of holes (ruling).
Every single word on the page was written on such a line, which was
drawn with either pencil or ink, or with a pointy object. Preparing the
page was a labor-intensive process, especially when the scribe had opted
for a complex layout, with multiple columns and glosses. It was
important to get it right, however, as a messy layout would produce a
messy book.
