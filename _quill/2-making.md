Cuddly quires

While the medieval book was made out of sheets, it is the quire that is
the object's building block. A quire is a small package of folded
sheets (bifolia or double-leaves) made of parchment, paper or off-cuts.
A medieval book consisted of twenty or more quires, which were held
together by a binding. How many bifolia or singletons a scribe would use
for a quire depended on his geographical location, among other things.

Copyists in England often opted for six double-leaves, while their
continental counterparts almost never did: they favored four. Some
late-medieval manuscripts, especially Paris Bibles contained quires with
a very high number of bifolia, eighteen or even more. Thick quires are
also found up in manuscripts made by chancery clerks, such as account
books. When you look at the top or bottom of a manuscript you can easily
spot the individual quires, all cuddled up inside the binding.
