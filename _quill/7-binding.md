*Packing it up* â€“
All that was left when the book was copied, corrected and decorated, was
to bind the quires together. If a book was made commercially, the client
would bring the complete quires to a binder and go over the options. At
the lower end of the scale are so-called limp bindings. Such bindings
consist of a stiff parchment sheet wrapped around the quires and
attached to them with stitches. They were very popular among students
because of their low costs.

At the other end of the scale were richly decorated bindings with wooden
boards and blind-tooled decoration. The motifs used in the decoration
can sometimes help us to relate a binding to a certain atelier or city.
Some even tell us who the binder was. 'Godefridus me fecit' says a
binding produced by Godefridus de Block, a fourteenth-century binder in
Brussels. Very rare are so-called 'treasure bindings', which covered
books, that needed to look handsome and rich, such as gifts or a Gospel
Book used for altar display.
