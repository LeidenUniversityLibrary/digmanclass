*Skins and scraps* â€“ For much of the Middle Ages dead cows were the main ingredient for
books. What was frolicking in the meadow one month, may have been a page
in a Bible the next. The skin of animals - calfs, goats, sheep - was
turned into parchment, which was subsequently cut into sheets. Parchment
was introduced in late Antiquity, when the codex, the book made of
double leaves, was born and started to replace the papyrus scroll. In
the 12th century another material appeared in Europe: paper.

Imported from Arabic culture, it was first exclusively used for
documentary purposes, such as account books and letters. In a remarkable
shift of scribal practices, in the fourteenth century scribes all over
Europe started to use paper for manuscripts. Conservative scribes, such
as monks, ignored the new material, while others, especially those who
wanted to economize, embraced it. Paper and parchment were used for all
sorts of manuscripts, from chunky volumes to small folded books.
