*Words, words, words* -
Parchment makers prepared skins, scribes cut their pens and filled their
ink pots, and binders packed their workshops with leather and wood. All
these activities would be in vane were it not for the single event that
sparked them: copying words. Writing a medieval text with a quill is
hard work. 'The fingers write, but the whole body suffers' says a
medieval saying. The pen could only move downwards because of how the
nib was cut, which meant that letters had to be broken up into multiple
pen strokes. This made writing a very slow process: a Bible could take a
year to complete. A scribe's handwriting -- script - can tell us where
and when he was trained to write. Script tells us these things because
the shape of letters was constantly changing. Script is thus an
important historical tool that helps to place stories and information
into the proper cultural-historical setting.
