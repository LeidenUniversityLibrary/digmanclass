Contrary to the editions published by Johannes Gutenberg and his successors –
which consist of multiple copies printed from the same setting of moveable
type – manuscript books are unique artefacts created with a pen and ink.
But this uniqueness does not mean that medieval scribes tended to work
unplanned and unguided by routine. Creating a codex is a craft that requires
skills and experience. Scribes are trained by teachers and colleagues;
they are formed by tradition (although traditions can differ in time and space,
as you will learn). Therefore, their workflows are to a large extent the same.
Basically, it all comes down to preparing the writing support, copying,
correcting and structuring the text, which will usually be protected by a
binding. After completion, books are handed over to readers, who in many cases
mark their presence on the page – be it the intended user or later owners.
The following introduction describes all these stages in eight short chapters,
each one referring to related topics in the Glossary.
