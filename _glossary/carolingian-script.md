*The unifier* â€“
Caroline Minuscule is the primary script of the early Middle Ages.
Created in the late eighth century, it became the main book script in
the empire of Charlemagne (d. 814). It is an elegant script with a
particularly round and spacious appearance Because Charlemagne had
conquered a vast amount of territory during his reign, he found himself
with an empire of many cultures, each with its own manner of writing.

A cohesive and unifying script was needed if his administration was to
function properly. Caroline Minuscule looks familiar to our modern eyes
because producers of typeface working for early Italian printers used it
as a model. In fact, the ubiquitous default font 'Times New Roman' on
our computers is also based on Caroline Minuscule.
