  - Making Quires and Sheets

*Building blocks* â€“
Quires, which were produced by bundling together a number of bifolia,
form the building blocks of the manuscript. How many bifolia the scribe
bundled together often depended on his or her location. Book producers
in England, for example, are known to have regularly produced quires of
six bifolia, while scribes on the Continent typically preferred quires
of four bifolia. Some quires are irregular. An extra folium could be
added (called a singleton) or a leaf could be cut out.

Such instances of irregularity are of great interest to book historians,
because they may suggest that the original composition was expanded by
the scribe (for which an extra folium was needed) or because a blank
folium was removed at a later stage (it came in handy for taking notes).
Scribes often produced the quires themselves, but it also appears that
they used prefabricated quires on occasion.
