*Testing, one, two, three* â€“
Scribes had to constantly adjust the nib of their quill by cutting it
into the right shape. A deformed nib would not supply an even flow of
ink, which resulted in letters that were not fully formed. To test if
the nib was in good shape, scribes would scribble a few swirly lines or
short words on an empty page. We usually find these pen trials in the
back of the book, where empty pages were usually found. Some pages are
loaded with them, including many that are written upside down, which
shows just how little the scribe cared about what his pen produced
during the testing phase. The most famous pen trial written in Dutch is
a poem jotted down by a monk who laments how all birds are building
nests, but that he, alas, is not. Anything goes for a trial.
