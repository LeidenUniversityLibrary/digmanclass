*Stowaway* â€“
When Gutenberg invented moving type, handwritten books quickly went out
of fashion. Many of these books became the victims of recycling at the
hands of binders, who cut up manuscripts to use them for added support
in the book bindings they made for new printed copies. Fragments could
also serve as a flyleaf. Like cars at a scrap yard, medieval books were
mutilated and plundered for parts until almost nothing was left.

Single pages and small strips were cut away from handwritten books and
pasted onto the boards and spines of their printed cousins. There they
remained, hidden out of sight, covered by the leather of the binding. In
spite of their mutilated appearance, these fragments can be of great
importance. The early history of the Bible, for example, could not have
been written without the fragmentary evidence retrieved from
early-modern bindings. While of modest size, the stowaways form
'blips' on the map of Europe, showing that a certain text was
available at a certain moment and location.
