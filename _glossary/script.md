*Between the lines* â€“
Medieval script - the handwriting of the scribe - is the material
representation of a text. An author may have composed the text,
producing the original thought, poem or story, but it was often the
scribe who put these words on the page. Much rides on how he did this.
If he was inexperienced, it may be difficult to decipher his writing. If
he was sloppy, the wrong words may appear on the page, or the right ones
in the wrong order.

The handwriting of scribes varied considerably. Not only did individual
scribes vary their individual letter forms, as we still do today, but
style of medieval script often depended on when and where it was
written. This makes script extremely useful for book historians: the
producer of a manuscript may tell us, between the lines, where and when
he made the book. My maker is from Germany, a letter or abbreviation may
for example say. From time to time scribes would even say so explicitly,
in a colophon at the end of the book.
