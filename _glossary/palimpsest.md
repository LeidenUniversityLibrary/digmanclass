*Stowaway* â€“
What to do when you run out of parchment as a medieval scribe? You can
look around for something else to write on, such as left-over parchment
strips in the bin (schedulae), or use paper if it is available.
Alternatively, you can take a book that is no longer used from your
monastery's library and scrape the text off its pages. You then simply
reapply text of your own. Such recycling resulted in a 'palimpsest',
which held a removed 'lower text' and a newer 'upper text'.

The ink of the reapplied text often does not stick to the page very
well. Moreover, the older reading often shines through. Especially
important are palimpsests from the earlier Middle Ages, because
underneath this old text an even older work is buried, like a stowaway.
With digital photography the lower text can sometimes be made visible
again, which makes studying these books like digging for treasure.
