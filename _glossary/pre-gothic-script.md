*The divider* â€“
From the middle of the eleventh century Caroline Minuscule, the dominant
book script at that time, started to include new letter forms. By 1100
the number of letter transformations had grown to such an extent that
the script looked different from Caroline. Slowly the script evolved
into what may be regarded as the second major book script of the Middle
Ages: Gothic (used from c. 1225).

Where Caroline was a unifying script, the transitional script of the
Long Twelfth Century (1075-1225) divided Europe in distinct regions.
Scribes in Europe adopted the new, hybrid writing form at different
speeds, while they also varied the actual appearance of certain letter
forms. Scribes in Germany, for example, were far more conservative than
their peers in France and England.
