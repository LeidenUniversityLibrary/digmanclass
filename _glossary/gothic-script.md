*Script standards* â€“
Books written between 1250 and 1600 were copied in a variety of Gothic
scripts, some of which sport very different features. On the one side of
the spectrum, there are formal book hands, presenting upright letters
that appear to stand at attention. On the other side there are more
casual cursive scripts, which were written with a thinner pen and
featured connecting loops.

By the early fifteenth century these two script forms were equally
popular, although cursive script was introduced much later in book
production. The introduction of cursive script is part of a broadening
palette of scripts. This expansion may have resulted from the
commercialization of book production - a consequence of the increasing
demands of readers who purchased their books in small urban shops.
