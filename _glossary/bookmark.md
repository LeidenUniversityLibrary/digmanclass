*Fossilized taste* â€“
The bookmark guided the reader to the beginning of a favorite chapter or
a significant section of the book. Flowers or leaves, which were
sometimes drawn into the manuscript, marked the page in the most elegant
and practical manner. More permanent and secure, however, are bookmarks
made from a piece of parchment that was pasted onto the page.

What a great thought, that medieval fingers inserted these stubs to get
to their literary fix! Some bookmarks are fragments of redundant
manuscripts, from which they were cut as a form of recycling. The stubs
are interesting to book historians because they show what texts of
passages were enjoyed by individuals that lived hundreds of years ago.
They are the fossilized remains of medieval literary taste.
