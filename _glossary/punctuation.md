  - Copying the Text
---

*Quoting, quoting, quoting* â€“
Most of modern punctuation was available to medieval scribes, although
they sometimes used it differently than we do today. In medieval times,
the period at the end of the line may for example be expressed with a
different symbol, such as a triple dot or even a comma. Medieval
quotation marks are placed in the margin and not in the actual text.
Moreover, the symbol is repeated over and over again in front of the
quotation. When the symbols stop, the quote is over. This practice is a
good example of the simplicity and effectiveness of medieval
punctuation.
