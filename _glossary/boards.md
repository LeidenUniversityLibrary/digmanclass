*Woodwork* â€“
Medieval manuscripts, even small ones, can be surprisingly heavy. Giant
Bibles, large volumes that can stand half a meter tall, weigh as much as
twenty-five kilos. It requires two library staff members to carry the
object to your table. Much of this weight is produced by the boards of
the bookbinding. To protect the stack of quires that made up the actual
manuscript, a wooden board was placed on the front and back. The quires
were then tied to thin leather straps, which were pushed through
channels drilled through the boards. The straps were pegged into the
wood. It produced a surprisingly firm binding, which lasted for
centuries. All this crafty woodwork is presently hidden from our eyes
because the boards were subsequently covered with leather (which was
often fitted with decorations. Thousands of pieces of medieval trees are
hidden inside book bindings, like a shelved mini forest.
