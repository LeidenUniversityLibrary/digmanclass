*Wrapper* â€“
The majority of surviving medieval bindings made use of wooden boards
which helped to protect the book and to keep the quires in place. The
so-called 'limp binding' is another type of binding that was in
popular use in medieval times. Its most notable feature is the absence
of boards, which explains its name. With a limp binding the quires are
covered by a plain parchment wrapper without the support of wooden
boards.

The quires in these bindings -- usually a limited number -- are attached
to the outer parchment with thin strings, which are visible on the
outside. A limp binding resulted in a lighter manuscript, which meant it
was easier to transport. This type of binding also decreased the cost,
given that wood was not needed and that the binding process was less
time-consuming. This is likely why this type of bookbinding is so
popular among medieval students.
