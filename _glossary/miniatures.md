*Mini paintings* â€“
Miniatures represent the most elaborate decoration on the medieval page.
They encompass scenes for which a significant amount of space - and
color - was reserved. Some are boxed in by a frame, while others appear
to float mid air. Their size and level of detail can vary widely. Books
of Hours often contain at least one full-page miniature. Some of these
were mass-produced and could be picked out by a client as he ordered the
book.

More common are smaller miniatures of half a page or less. These were
normally added after the copying of the text was completed: the scribe
would bring the completed quire to the decorator, who would subsequently
do his thing. Miniatures are in effect mini paintings executed by
well-known artists: they added significantly to the bill of the reader
who commissioned a book.
