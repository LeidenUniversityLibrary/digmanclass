*The cheaper alternative* â€“
Paper became an alternative to parchment in the later Middle Ages. The
new material was introduced into Europe in the late twelfth century.
Initially imported from the Arabic world by merchants, from the second
half of the twelfth century paper was also produced in European mills,
first in Italy and Spain, then in France, and finally in England and
Germanic countries. At first, the new material was exclusively used in
administration.

It was not until the late thirteenth century, however, that paper was
introduced in book production, where it became a more affordable (and
sometimes more plentiful) alternative to parchment. Although paper made
the production of manuscripts somewhat cheaper, the objects still
remained expensive: they were a luxury good for people with less money.
The watermark that is usually found in a paper sheet helps the book
historian date and localize the paper batch used for a manuscript.
