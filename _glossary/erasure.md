  - Correcting the Text
---

*Mistake be gone!* â€“
How did a medieval scribe correct a mistake? If you forgot to copy a
word, you could simply insert it in between the lines of the completed
text. If you had written down the wrong word or sentence, correcting the
text could take considerable more effort. In such cases scribes often
resorted to their knife. Dried ink could be 'snapped' off the page
with the knife's tip.

Once the words were removed the correct reading was placed in the gap.
However, a mistake was never fully deleted. You can often still vaguely
see the outlines of the original text on the parchment, much like in a
palimpsest. Moreover, the surface of the spots usually feels slightly
softer, which is gives away that the scribe intervened with a knife.
