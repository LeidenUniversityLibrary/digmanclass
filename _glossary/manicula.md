*Helping Hand* â€“
With a nota-sign the reader expressed that a passage was noteworthy or
deserved a closer read. The manicula (Latin for 'little hand') was
another means to do so. As with 'nota-signs', the actual form of the
pointing finger varies considerably. Readers may have had their own
unique design to distinguish their hands from those of other readers.

The hands are sometimes accompanied by short notes, which the reader may
have written in response to the text. As with bookmarks and nota-signs,
maniculae show us what information were deemed important or relevant to
an individual long ago. In that sense they lend a helping hand to the
book historian as much as they did to the medieval reader.
