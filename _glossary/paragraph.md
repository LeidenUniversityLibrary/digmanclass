*Gallows* â€“
Both longer and shorter medieval texts were usually divided into smaller
sections called paragraphs. In the early days of the paragraph, in the
ninth century, they often had the appearance of a plain 'hook'
resembling the gallows. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries more
sophisticated variants began to appear. First, diagonal lines started to
connect the horizontal and vertical part of the paragraph.

Then, in the age of the scholastic book, the reading aid received our
modern shape: a 'c' with a vertical line struck through its centre. In
scholastic texts this type of paragraph often came in two alternating
colors: red and blue. They appear to mark the 'lector', the passage
that was read out loud in the classroom an which was subsequently
discussed. The c-symbol indicated the start of such a passage, while the
colors made it easier to know when to stop reading.
