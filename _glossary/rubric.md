*Spoiler* â€“
As Spanish bull fighters know, red is an excellent color for attracting
attention. In manuscripts it was used for the rubric (from the Latin
word for 'red'). Placed at the outset of each chapter, rubrics
provided the reader with an indication of what the following chapter was
about. Now that was handy! Some were very short and simply stated
'about such and such' while others were quite elaborate - spoilers,
even, which revealed in detail what the reader was about to read.

The color red set the words apart from the black or brown words of the
main text. Moreover, the bright color on the otherwise dull page acted
as a reading aid: it helped the reader find certain information in an
efficient manner. If red was not available, scribes would write the
chapter titles in a different script to make it stand out from the main
text.
