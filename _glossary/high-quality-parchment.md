*Perfect skin* â€“
Up to around 1300, most books in Europe were made from animal skin -
parchment. The quality of these sheets varied considerably. Like people
today, not all medieval creatures had perfect skin. Some cows loved to
rub against trees and others were particularly prone to insect bites. We
can still see these defects on the medieval page today, which appear as
tiny holes, gaps or dark patches.

The quality of the page also had a lot to do with preparation. A scribe
producing a book for his own library may be less attentive than one that
worked in a monastic community. The best sheets have a deep-white color,
with a hint of yellow. They feel like velvet and make a slight rustling
sound when you turn the page - suspenseful whispers that teased the
reader.
