*Tablet* â€“
This clever device from Antiquity provided the user with a layer of wax
on a wooden frame to capture his thoughts. With a little pressure from
the stylus, words were etched into the wax. They could easily be wiped
away again, so the device could be reused. A little pressure from the
stylus would create ideas, which could subsequently be wiped again. The
classroom was a place where wax tablets were used on a daily basis, at
least up until the fourteenth century.
