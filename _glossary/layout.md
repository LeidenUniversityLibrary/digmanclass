  - Preparing the Page
---

*Puzzle* â€“
Before a scribe could begin to fill the quires with text, the layout of
the page needed to be designed and prepared by means of pricking and
ruling. How a page was designed depended on a variety of factors,
including the number of required text columns, the space left blank for
decoration, and the presence of marginal glosses and running titles. The
most basic layout consisted of a single column of text. They are
frequently encountered in Books of Hours, because these are commonly
smaller books, which facilitated portability. Bigger books of two or
more columns often required more work in the design stage, especially if
that book also featured a marginal commentary. Particularly challenging
were those cases where the commentary was of unequal length, as seen
here. This meant that the scribe had to design each page separately.
Piecing together the segments of main text and commentary was like
solving a puzzle.
