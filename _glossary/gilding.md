  - Decorating the Book
---

*Dazzling* â€“
Some medieval readers preferred pretty pictures and shiny decoration in
their books. Not only did the sparkling page appeal to them, it also
proved their economic status, or that the gift they gave was special.
Undecorated books were also expensive, but decorated copies cost a true
fortune, especially if gold was used. In a process called gilding, the
decorator would apply an ultra-thin film of flattened gold to the page,
which looked not unlike our modern tin foil. Golden shapes were not
appended directly to the surface of the parchment, but that they were
stretched over little 'hills' of plaster. This way the gold would
catch the light from different angles, maximizing its dazzling effect.
