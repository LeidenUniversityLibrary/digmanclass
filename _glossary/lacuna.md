  - Correcting the Text
---

*Mind the gap!* â€“
Most flaws scribes encountered when they corrected a manuscript could
and would be fixed immediately. Others, however, required some time. The
scribe may have wanted to deliberate the text with someone else or look
something up, for example in a glossary. Such time-consuming fixes were
usually done after the text was fully copied out. In such cases the
scribe would leave room in the text to reinsert the checked reading at a
later stage.

When he had finished copying, a text could potentially have been riddled
with lacunae, standing at the ready to receive the new readings. Scribes
would hide any and all traces of these corrections by using the same ink
color and writing in the same manner, which means they are difficult to
spot. The practice of using lacunae for inserting improved readings is
particularly common in autograph copies. Translators, for example, often
needed some time to find equivalents for unusual words in the original
language.
