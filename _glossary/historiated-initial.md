*One-letter stories* â€“
Normally, letters work together to form words that present a story. From
time to time, however, we encounter a letter that contains a narrative
all by itself. Initials that marked the beginning of the text could
contains an identifiable scene or figure that often related to the text.
The meaning of some historiated initials can only be understood by
reading the story they initiate. Miniatures contained even more
extensive narratives.
