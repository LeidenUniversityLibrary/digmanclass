*Add-ons* â€“
Many medieval books were a joy to look at even when they were closed.
Various shiny 'add-ons' were drilled in and attached to the wooden
boards on the outside of the book. The most pronounced of these are the
so-called 'bosses', protective metal pieces attached to each corner of
the binding. Much more common are clasps, pieces of metal that kept the
book closed.

These were needed because, unlike paper, parchment has a tendency to
expand, which could push the book open. A clasp was therefore needed to
keep the book closed when not in use, protecting the text inside. Also
frequently added to the binding is decoration - flower motifs, playful
line patterns, and at times even a painted scene. Such decorative
elements on the outside of the binding became particularly common near
the end of the Middle Ages.
