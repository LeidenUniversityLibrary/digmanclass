  - Using the Book
---

*Add-on* â€“
From the moment we learn to read as a child we are told not to write in
our books. Still, we often do, especially when we use the book for
school. If it is not our own copy, we may write with pencil, so that our
personal thoughts may be removed after use. Medieval readers had no
problem writing in the margins, and apparently had no qualms about using
permanent ink. In fact, it is hard to point out a manuscript that does
not contain any such add-ons. Some of these notes (or glosses) were
extensive, and the scribe had to extend the margins to accommodate them.
