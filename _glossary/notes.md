*Sticky note* â€“
Readers had the ability to mark important passages with a nota-sign or a
manicula. When a passage prompted a response or an explanation, the
reader could provide these in the form of a marginal gloss. More
extensive notes were sometimes written on tiny paper or parchment slips.

Students are known to have used them to take down notes in the classroom
or when they were studying a text at home. Few of them survive today.
Not only were they easy to lose, but many of them were actually thrown
out, similar to the fate of our modern day 'sticky notes'. In some
manuscripts they survive because they were tucked in between the pages.
