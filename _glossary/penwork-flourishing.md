*Drunk decoration* â€“
In medieval times, penwork flourishing was the quickest and easiest way
to add some color to the page. This style of decoration typically
involves thin lines, usually in red and blue, drawn with a pen rather
than a brush. The swirly lines form lively patterns with unexpected
twists and turns, creating miniature mazes in which your eye gets lost
easily. If you look carefully you may recognize familiar objects: a
tree, the moon, pearls, a smiling face. The central figure attracting
all of this artistic attention is the capital letter that needed
decorating. The penwork decoration supported an important function of
this letter, navigating the reader to the beginning of a new section of
text. The specific flourishing patterns can often be pinpointed to a
certain city or region, which turns these happy lines into a useful tool
for the book historian
