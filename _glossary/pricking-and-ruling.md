*Cobweb* â€“
Unlike our notebooks today, medieval paper and parchment sheets did not
come with ruled lines when you purchased them. A medieval page consisted
of both horizontal and vertical ruling. To add these guiding lines to
the blank page, the scribe would prick tiny holes in the outer margins,
as well as in the upper and lower ones. Lines were then drawn between
these holes, usually with the help of a ruler: horizontal lines to guide
the space between each line of text, and vertical lines to confine the
left and right side of the textblock.

Until the early twelfth century the ruling was done by pressing down on
the parchment with a sharp object, producing a 'gutter' that would
guide the scribe's pen (called 'dry point'). This type of ruling was
replaced by drawing lines with a pencil or pen, which left more visible
traces on the surface of the page (called 'plummet'). If a layout was
very complex, the ruling pattern may appear as a cobweb of horizontal
and vertical lines.
