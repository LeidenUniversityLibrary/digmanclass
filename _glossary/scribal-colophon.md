*Give me drink* â€“
The medieval manuscript lacked a title page, which was invented by
fifteenth-century printers. Without a title page, it can be difficult to
determine where, when, or by whom the book was made. To the medieval
reader, however, much of this information was either irrelevant or
already known. Why state that a text is by Augustine if you can easily
determine that yourself by simply reading the first lines?

Lucky for us, on occasion, scribes added a colophon to the book (almost
always found on the last page). The colophon provides us with similar
information now copied onto title pages. A scribe may state, for
example, in which year he copied the book, where he lived, and, in some
cases, even for whom the book was made. Some colophons provide a more
prosaic fact, for example that a scribe is thirsty: 'This work is
completed, master, now give me a drink!'
