  - Correcting the Text
---

*X marks the spot* â€“
When a scribe noticed that text was missing he usually inserted the
missing words next or over the place where they were needed. The reader
would know when to read them from the context. However, if the omission
encompassed one or more lines it could be challenging to determine at
which point they should be read, and the correction may not have fitted
between the lines of the text.

In such cases the scribe would reach out to the reader and connect the
marginal insertion to its proper location with a symbol called a *signe
de renvoi*. They were usually simple symbols, such as crosses, lines, or
sequences of dots.
