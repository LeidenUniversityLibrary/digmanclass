*Navigating the book* â€“
Medieval scribes recognized that readers may need some help finding
their way throughout the book or within the texts they contained. Over
time, a number of tools were invented to this end. Many of them we still
use today, such as the page number (foliation), the running title, and
the index.

In medieval manuscripts colorful initials marked the opening of a new
chapter. Thumbing through the book, in search of a particular section of
text, the letters would jump out at the reader. Another important tool
for finding certain information was the rubric: red lines that indicated
what the next section will discuss. Lines highlighted with a green wash
expressed where the reader should start reading. Combined, these three
are a clever lot, helping the reader navigate the book and text at a
fast pace.
