  - Making Quires and Sheets

*Location, location* â€“
As with our modern books, medieval manuscripts consist of quires: small
packages of folded leaves. The scribe would copy the text onto the pages
of the quire, which would later be bound together to form the completed
manuscript. To make sure that each finished quire ended up in the
correct order, the scribe often wrote the first words of the next quire
in the lower margin of the last page he copied.

These are called 'catchwords'.

If the catchword at the end of the quire matched the first word on the
next quire, then they were in the correct sequence. Sometimes, to
further help binders put the quires in the right order, scribes would
number them. In the later Middle Ages, further organization was added to
the page by also numbering the individual bifolia, so as to keep track
of their specific location within the quire. In spite of all this
emphasis on location, from time to time binders still jumbled up the
sequence.
