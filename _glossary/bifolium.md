  - Making Quires and Sheets
---

*Bonding sheets* â€“
Quires are usually made from bifolia (singular: bifolium) or double
sheets of parchment or paper. To create a bifolium, a sheet is folded in
half (each half is called a 'folium', which consists of two 'pages',
i.e. the front and back of the folium). If the quire is the building
block of the medieval book, the bifolium is what defines the quire:
four, five or six of them were bundled up and subsequently filled with
text.

Looking closely at the binding of the book, each bifolium appears to
embrace its neighbor, bonding together to produce a strong quire. Before
roughly 1200, bifolia were usually cut from processed animal skins, each
of which usually supplied one to three double sheets. They were either
cut from the skin or the skin was simply folded, either once (folio),
twice (quarto), or three times (octavo). Paper double sheets were
exclusively produced by folding the full sheet.
