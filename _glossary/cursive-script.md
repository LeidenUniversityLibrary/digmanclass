*Migration of letter forms* â€“
Cursive script began its career in the world of administration. Here it
was used for account books, charters and other administrative texts. The
clerks who produced these documents used a much thinner pen than what
was used for formal book script. The flexible tip allowed for a faster
pace and it gave the script a kind of 'casual' feel.

While book script required the pen to be lifted between each stroke that
formed the letter, with cursive script the pen remained on the surface
of the page, with each letter connected by a ligature (or loop). Around
1300 this administrative script was exported to the world of book
production. Students and scholars were early adopters, as were
individuals involved in administrative duties, such as clerks, notaries
and merchants. Civic clerks, for example, are known to have produced
literary manuscripts after-hours, in part for an urban clientele who
paid for their services. These professional users encouraged the
migration of the script
