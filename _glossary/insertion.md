  - Correcting the Text

*Insert \[text\] here* â€“
When the medieval scribe had finished his work, he or another scribe
usually went through the entire manuscript to make sure he had made no
mistakes. He did so while comparing his work to the exemplar, the book
he had copied his text from. Mistakes he encountered would be erased.

When it became apparent that he had skipped a word or even a whole
sentence or paragraph, he could simply amend it by copying the omitted
text nearby. Readers would also insert missing words themselves, if the
scribe had failed to do so.
