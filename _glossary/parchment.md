*Dead cows* â€“
What was once a calf, sheep or goat frolicking grazing in the meadow,
may now be a page in a manuscript. That is not a bad way to go. It is a
strange experience leafing through a medieval book, knowing that you are
touching an animal that stopped breathing over 500 years ago. Sometimes
the page shows the tiny dots where the hairs once grew. Up to c. 1300
books in Europe were almost exclusively made from animal skin. Then
scribes started to use paper, tempted as they were by the lower cost of
the material.

However, parchment was regarded as the more durable of the two: 'If you
want a real book, use parchment' was the sentiment in the streets,
which is why some scribes, particularly monks, were hesitant to use
paper as default material. When in c. 1450 the printing press arrived,
animal skin quickly became obsolete, although the trend was already set
half a century earlier.
