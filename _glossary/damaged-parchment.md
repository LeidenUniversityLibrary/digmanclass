*Damaged goods* â€“
'Be careful what you buy in the city of Erfurt: they sell you animals
skins to which letters will not stick.' This complaint of a medieval
scribe shows that these craftsmen were well aware of the varying quality
of animal skins, which they used as the basis for their books. However,
calves, sheep or goats that had gruntingly given up their livelihood and
skin for the sake of medieval readers were not always to blame.

The most common imperfections are holes produced by the knife of the
parchment maker. When he cleaned the skin with his knife, it was
strapped on a wooden frame: tight like a drum a small puncture easily
became a gaping hole. The art of preparing animal skin was to apply just
the right amount of pressure. Readers did not seem to mind the holes too
much and scribes usually just wrote around them, or they repaired them.
