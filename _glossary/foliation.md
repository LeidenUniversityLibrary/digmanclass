*One, two, three* â€“
Until the invention of the page number readers had no means to find a
particular page in the book quickly. The system medieval scribes came up
with is slightly different from our modern pagination. Only one side of
each leaf was given a number, meaning that medieval 'foliation'
referred to not one but two pages. Although the practice of placing a
number sequence throughout the book is observed in some earlier
manuscripts, it became popular in the thirteenth century. Scholars at
the university, for example, found it easier to reference information on
certain pages if they were numbered. The sequential numbering of leaves
allowed for the production of more detailed subject indexes and tables
of contents, both of which are still in use today. Finding information
was now as easy as one, two, three.
