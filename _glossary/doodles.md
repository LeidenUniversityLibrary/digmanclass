Doodles are little bundles of fun. Usually drawn with a pen, they often
appear to be the result of a scribe trying out his pen. In such cases it
was tempting to draw something meaningful, if absurd. Humor is a main
ingredient of the doodle, which may show a mouse chasing a cat, a funny
face staring at the reader, a skeleton with a glass in his hand, or a
husband and wife in the midst of an argument.

Doodles often incorporate such native elements of the page. Various
doodles made by children also survive in schoolbooks, which shows that
doodling may also be a universal sign of boredom in the classroom.
