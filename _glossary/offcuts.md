*Yellow sticky note* â€“
When the scribe cut sheets out of the animal hide, he would normally use
the best part of the skin - what may be called the 'prime cut'. This
meant staying clear of the very edge of the skin because these areas
were very thin and translucent, and deemed unsuitable for books. The
scribe therefore cut a rim of parchment from the edge of the skin. It
usually came off in tiny bits and pieces, which he called 'schedulae' - strips.

These odds and ends were thrown in the bin. Sometimes they were taken
out to be used as scraps, for example for taking notes in the classroom.
They also served as smaller pages inserted into existing manuscripts.
Tipped into the quire these tiny pages supplemented the text or added
notes, like yellow sticky notes.
