*Abbrev.* â€“
From 'app' to 'math': abbreviating words is human. Why write words
in full if a shorter version will do? Medieval scribes agreed. The
manuscripts they made are usually packed with abbreviations. Perhaps the
most common is the macron: a line above a letter that represents the
letter n or m.

Another popular abbreviation mark is the 7-shaped symbol for 'et'
(and). The number and kinds of abbreviations varied. Manuscripts with
liturgical texts usually have few abbreviations, while they are abundant
in those filled with university texts, such as Aristotle. Abbreviations
may also be problematic. They are only useful, after all, if the reader
can understand them.
