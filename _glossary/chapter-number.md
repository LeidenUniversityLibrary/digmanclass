*Chapter and verse* â€“
While running titles told the reader what text was found on a particular
page, the chapter number narrowed down its contents even further. As
with many other navigational aids, the practice of numbering the
chapters goes back to the Carolingian Age. They appear to have become
standardized much later, however, perhaps as late as the twelfth
century.

In the thirteenth century, a Bible redaction was made in Paris (the
'Paris Bible') wherein the numbering of the chapters became
standardized, something that was not a given before then. This meant
that two individuals discussing Genesis 15 were actually talking about
the same text for the first time. Many works used in university
education had an additional tool to define the location within the text
even more precisely, the paragraph.
