*You are here* â€“
Running titles have a long history. They are encountered in manuscripts
made as early as the sixth century. Their main use was to indicate to
the reader where in the book he or she was. Early examples merely reveal
the given book within the text - stating, for example 'Liber primus'
(Book 1). With the coming of the scholastic manuscript in the late
twelfth century, used at universities throughout Europe, the running
titles became more sophisticated. They would often provide the reader
with the full title of the text at a given page.

Moreover, the presentation of the running title became smarter as well.
It became split up and spread out over both top margins of a book
opening: half of the text title on the left page, the other half on the
right page. An equally early adopter of this clever type is the Paris
Bible, a popular tool among preachers on the road. Like students, they
needed to find texts and passages quickly. 'You are here' they seem to
say, 'Now you do your thing'.
