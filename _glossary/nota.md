*Note to self* â€“
While the bookmark guided the reader to an important chapter or text,
the nota-sign marked a significant passage or sentence on the page. From
time to time readers noticed something in the text worth highlighting.
In such cases they wrote the Latin 'nota' in the margin, which means
to 'examine' or 'inspect'. While some of these nota-signs may have
served as a reminder to check something, others appear to express a more
generic 'attention!' like the 'manicula' did.

The nota-sign is not written like a normal word. Rather, its four
letters are reshuffled and stretched so as to form a unique symbol. This
was likely done to distinguish a reader's passages from those marked by
other users of the book, such as his fellow brethren in the monastery.
